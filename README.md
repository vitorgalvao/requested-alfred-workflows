# Requested Alfred Workflows

These are short Workflows made to help [Alfred Forum](https://www.alfredforum.com/) users. They are quick, dirty, and unmaintained, built solely to scratch the itch of the user that asked for it. Presentation details such as icons and descriptions are ignored. They are stored here because it became increasingly frequent that another user eventually found the old thread where the Workflow was posted, wanted to download it to fix their similar issue and found a broken link.

If you’re looking for my maintained Workflows shared to the community as a whole, you’ll find them in [another repository](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/).
